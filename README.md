Just another repository
Hello I am Adeline. It is Halloween today. I wanna go out and dress up. But I have a coding class to attend. It's okay. I signed up for this coding class myself and finally got it after applying for the 3rd time so I should def appreciate the opportunity :)
Wishing everyone a Scary Halloween!
